# Debug Mode
<p class="uk-article-lead">There are situations where the root cause for an error is not clear and requires extra steps to detect.</p>

By default Pagekit will hide any PHP error, in order to show it the **Debug Mode** must be enabled in _System > Settings_ or set to true in the [configuration file](/getting-started/configuration-file.md) manually. 

**Note** If the error happens during installation the configuration file will not exist. In such case you should edit the default config file located in `app/installer/config.php`.

The same way you may enable the **Debug Toolbar** which will provide some useful information about the environment. Notice that some server errors may prevent the toolbar from being displayed.

> Remember to disable the _Debug_ and _Debug Toolbar_ when the site is deployed on a production server.
